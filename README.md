# CodeSnippets
Various useful bits of code to perform small tasks that might be useful for others as well.

- `AddRandomClade`: Simulate missing diversity based on the [`add.random`](http://blog.phytools.org/2013/01/adding-new-tips-at-random-to-phylogeny.html) code by Liam Revell. Function to randomly add tips to a phylogeny based on different sampling levels per clade. A simplistic approximation of how missing diversity could be distributed, _e.g._ for sensitivity analyses.
